    <p>A woman sat in the dirt, legs crossed. The movement did not look natural. No, it compared to a lamb that had fallen over onto its back. She was so lonely, so lonely. She drew a blanket around her for warmth and began trudging through the long dirt road. As she walked, the cloth became filthy and diseased. It collected dirt and flesh littered along the trail. It grew hide, thick and dense and angry. It grew angry.</p>

    <div class="line"></div>
    
<p>I am screaming as though a swarm of leeches is upon me. You defiled me. Pieces of me fall away into the red mud, but I am still growing. I cannot look before me. I can only see the viscera that I leave as my eyes are drawn out by the rubble and gore. Where are you going? Can you even hear me? I am being dragged by my feet into hell and the devil is humming a lullaby.</p>

    <div class="line"></div>
  <i>  
<p>Trudging through warm dew</p>
<p>Along the muddied track</p>
<p>Feeding the notion</p>
<p>And the ticks on your back</p>
<p>I'll cut my ears off so I don't hear you</p>
<p>I'll feed them to you</p>
<p>I'll feed them to you</p>
    
<p>The mass or corpses, purple and blue
<p>A living rind
<p>Do you wonder if they're alive
<p>Deaf and blind and one-of-a-kind
<p>Oh, how you grew
<p>I'll feed them to you
<p>I'll feed them to you</p>

<p>A blanket sat in the mud, swollen and twitching. The movement did not look natural. No, it compared to a swollen tick that had fallen over onto its back. It uprooted itself and drew its red cloak tight. A tormented face bled through the rosy cloth as the blanket traveled on. The blanket paid it no mind, even after it began to sing softly.</p>

    <i>
<p>The ticks chatter and chew</p>
<p>On varnished phlegm</p>
<p>Come closer, bloated ones</p>
<p>And I’ll whisper to them</p>
<p>In this bloodied brew</p>
<p>“I’ll feed them to you”</p>
<p>“I’ll feed them to you”</p>
