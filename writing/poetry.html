        <div class=poetrytitle>God is a Microwave that Speaks Through the Chemical Process of Melting Butterflies</div>
        <p>Once when I was young<br>
I felt a caterpillar crawl crosst’ hath<br>
Thine outstretched palm</p>

<p>Prints kissed with invisible tread<br>
His spines of yellow and cape of red<br>
Spiked fur adorned his crown</p>

<p>I speak through him now</p>

<p>I perch across’d that cloth of reality and whisper into its linen<br>
Softly diverging thread and stitch along fated intention<br>
And I say<br>
God speaks through butterflies in the microwave</p>

<p>Would he speak with chest so concave<br>
And wings so melted to puddle<br>
Oh lord, how you muddle my brain!</p>

<p>Homestead-<br>
Cast aside bagged bread<br>
For he is risen!<br>
From his prison!<br>
Glimpsed in every angle of the prism<br>
Of the butterfly wings</p>

<p>Out of his chrysalis<br>
What risen kingdom is this<br>
Stored in a vat of insect piss<br>
And black bile<br>
Oh how the Nile will flow with his blood<br>
Til’ every paved road melts to mud</p>

<p>Sodden wings ruffled in the breath-<br>
In the breadth of his majesty<br>
Lord, please speak to me!</p>

<p>Lowered from glass cup into the machine<br>
Into the maw<br>
Where he will spin<br>
Idly for six seconds<br>
And two minutes<br>
Moments impregnated by breath held in it</p>

<p>I stare into his cage<br>
I turn the page<br>
Nothing but melted butterfly remains

        <div class=poetrytitle>There are Dyning Gnats in my Hair</div>
        <p>The news said that he died looking at dead gnats on his paper<br>
Yes, they say they fell right out of his hair<br>
Quite!<br>
Right out of his chair!<br>
Writhing on the ground<br>
Just like those damned gnats<br>
Redeyed, but at least they died<br>
Doing what they loved</p>

<p>Falling out of my hair and onto my english paper<br>
Uhhh i don't know how they got there<br>
I’ve never seen that gnat before<br>
Not before I saw him writhing around on the dust-colored floor</p>

<p>Free to go <br>
Save for the gnat-man’s life that laid in my hands<br>
Gnat-jesus would understand <br>
I’ll sit under god’s right gnat-hand<br>
Maybe i can make it into gnat-heaven

        <div class=poetrytitle>Dating the Phenotypical Adjacent to a Swarm of Killer Bees</div>
        <p>Millions of eyes<br>
Ibuprofen prescribed<br>
Til all that I felt was your last kiss</p>

<p>Stinging vertebrae<br>
T-10 through C-4<br>
Bombs away in oceanic abyss</p>

<p>Once the rain stops<br>
I’ll hear the clip-clops<br>
Of automobiles brought back from the dead</p>

<p>Trashed trophy wives<br>
Fucking sick of your lies<br>
Fucking sick of your millions of billions of eyes</p>

<p>Your tear-ducts in drought<br>
But you’ll hear the wind blow<br>
Frozen black legs<br>
Each one dead in the vanilla snow</p>

<p>Remembering times<br>
When the hills loved your eyes<br>
Ginger ale stuck to your breath</p>

<p>Perpetual amnesia <br>
Forget anesthesia<br>
Caught in the silver monocle of death</p>

<p>I wish you had cried<br>
Can’t one of us die<br>
And let the other rest<br>
In the lungs of the paper wasp nest

        <div class=poetrytitle>Radio Silence</div>
        <p>My mind doesn’t make sense anymore<br>
Thought my memory machine was long busted<br>
And when I thought a hammer was enough<br>
Did you hire a repairman?<br>
But I can remember every goddamn second we spent together<br>
I wish these memories weren’t mine anymore<br>
Wish I could<br>
CLOSE THAT SCREEN DOOR<br>
And stop sharing these goddamn memories with two strangers<br>
On opposite sides of the moon</p>

<p>Remember when you were nice enough<br>
To pretend to love me?<br>
Fuck dude<br>
Wish you were stupid enough to rethink this<br>
Wish you thought you’d made the worst mistake of your life<br>
Wish you knew this was your knife</p>

<p>I see your face<br>
In awful shapes<br>
And cast in shadow<br>
As I traipse across the hallway<br>
Hope you don’t look my way</p>

<p>Because it’s so goddamn lonely in caps lock<br>
Down here where muscle memory keeps things fresh<br>
In my mind<br>
When you were kind enough<br>
To pretend I was pretty<br>
Enough</p>

<p>Not dirt, kid, that’s salt<br>
Malted meshing<br>
Keep it refreshing<br>
Because you can’t afford to lose<br>
A rope burn like this<br>
With traces of bliss<br>
In every crevice of your palms</p>

<p>I had the distinctly unlovable slab of meat dream again<br>
You know, the one where you or her<br>
Or some other figure<br>
Sneaks under my bed and asks to hold my hand</p>

<p>And as a wise friend once said:<br>
“Why, that was just a feeling!”<br>
Yes, just a feeling<br>
Just a funny little feeling that wants to be loved<br>
A funny little feeling that wept when he thought you had died<br>
And wept more when you left him for dead</p>

<p>“No more blind moves”<br>
My ass<br>
Eat glass-<br>
Go blind for all I care</p>

<p>Not grass, kid, that’s rot<br>
And you expect me to sit like a band-aid<br>
In your filthy blood clot

        <p>Grandmother’s gift<br>
Tricks the delightful faith<br>
That was once bestowed within<br>
Me</p>

<p>Her pretty jaundice-yellow<br>
Grandmother-proofed pills<br>
Seem more sinister</p>

<p>Father is generationally sandwiched<br>
Between a sedated deprecated beast<br>
And a growing fetus<br>
Gnawing on headboards, crackers<br>
Peppermints</p>

<p>Smack him DOWN<br>
Before he sees something dreadful<br>
In the night sky above his dog<br>
Or starts hearing the ambient whispers<br>
Oh-so denied and<br>
The wall that’s made of lies</p>

<p>No faith bestowed in<br>
Infected roots<br>
Topsoil too thin<br>
Shoveling too far in

        <div class=poetrytitle>The Realistic Legitimacy of Events Past Summer 2015 is Questionable (at Best)</div>
        <p>I’m sure I’m dreaming because I’ve never had this many fingers before<br>
And the ground I’m standing on<br>
Never looked so inviting<br>
And nothing feels real anymore<br>
Not the man in the woods<br>
And not the slow breathing under the bed down the hall<br>
Because that’s just your dog<br>
That’s your dog</p>

<p>But I’m going blind in my deaf eye<br>
And left in my right<br>
Dear mother please sing to me tonight<br>
Because you sing with a tempo that can make dogs smile<br>
Silent Night sung at the kitchen table<br>
Cookies and soy milk make things alright</p>

<p>Until<br>
It’s all<br>
Acetaminophen boys<br>
And<br>
Ibuprofen girls</p>

<p>And the air around me dissolves in a<br>
Orange Vanilla Coca Cola - Grenadine swirl</p>

<p>I’m sure that I’m dreaming because<br>
Dawn nears with fractal imprints<br>
On my face and arms<br>
And the beautiful songbirds are singing a melody<br>
Too true to be true to me</p>

<p>As I wake<br>
My legs prickle with unfeeling<br>
And as they refill with hot blood<br>
They feel frigid<br>
As though death crept up closed arteries</p>

<p>Coldest tweezers hold them open like gentlemen</p>

<p>I’m sure I’m dreaming because this can’t be the time<br>
The middle hand’s red<br>
And the short hand’s at nine</p>

<p>Tornado sirens on a Tuesday<br>
Heard twice in a row<br>
No, I don’t want to know<br>
I don’t want to know<br>
How far down the rabbit hole<br>
Lilac roots can go<br>
When laid to rest<br>
On less than four inches of snow
